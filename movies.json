Daughter to the flamboyant lesbian Queens of Planet Clitopolis, introverted Princess Saira is devastated when her bounty-hunter girlfriend, Kiki, suddenly breaks up with her for being too needy. After Kiki is kidnapped by forgotten incels of the future, the Straight White Maliens, Saira must leave the comforts of gay space to deliver their ransom: her royal labrys (the most powerful weapon known to lesbian kind). Only problem is… she doesn’t have it! With just a 24-hour window to get her labrys and save Kiki, Princess Saira finds herself on an inter-gay-lactic journey of self-discovery that includes encounters with a problematic spaceship and a new-found friendship with gay-pop runaway Willow.\n\nAn animated comedy like no other, Lesbian Space Princess is a riotous, candy-coloured joy from start to finish: a locally made animation by emerging creatives that embraces LGBTQIA+ and culturally diverse voices, on and off-screen.",
