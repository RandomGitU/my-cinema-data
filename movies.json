But fifteen years later, he and his wife Helen (a famous former superhero in her own right) have been forced to take on civilian identities and retreat to the suburbs. Today they live as mere mortals and lead alltoo-ordinary lives with their children— who go out of their way to appear “normal.” As a clockpunching insurance man, the only thing Bob fights these days is boredom and a bulging waistline.
